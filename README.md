An external circuit involving a Matrix 4x4 keypad, a Hitachi LCD, and the eight-bit PIC18F4685 on an external breadboard has been wired together alongside this project. User entered data (via the 4x4 Matrix keypad) is sent serially through the PIC's built-in transmit (TX) and receive (RX). Pressing 'A' on the keypad scrolls text to the right, 'B' acts as a back-space, 'C' clears the LCD, and 'D' scrolls text to the left.
